As I've heard someone recently say, the amount of new Agile methods or methodologies is competing with the number of new JavaScript frameworks that pop up every now and then. When it comes to new Agile methods, they all usually have certain things in common (the Agile principles) but they come with a twist.

When it comes to [Grows](http://growsmethod.com/), as far as I understood from the podcast, the twist comes from the short feedback loops, involvement of executive roles, the tech best practices and the gradual development of the method in 5 stages (modelled after the [Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition)). It sounds like it also guides you and your team in adopting an Agile practice, with all kind of tips and tricks and best practices, technical or organizational.

Besides listening to the [podcast](http://ryanripley.com/afh-042-the-grows-method-for-adopting-agile-software-development-podcast/), could be interesting to read this [InfoQ article](https://www.infoq.com/articles/grows-method-experiment) or visit the [Grows website](http://growsmethod.com/) to find out more.
