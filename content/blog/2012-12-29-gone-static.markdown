Having a small blog where you can ramble about whatever you want should be a simple thing, right? I mean you don't pay much to the host, they have installation scripts for any platform you like, you just buy a domain (if you want) and you start writing! Well, that's only in theory, at least for me.

It all started a few months ago with my domain `alexchiri.ro` just disappearing from the records of my host at that time, [icebluehost.com](http://icebluehost.com). '_Weird_', I said to myself and opened a ticket. They did 'something' and then the domain worked again, but I wasn't able to see it in my [CPanel](http://cpanel.net/) and I couldn't add MX records to it so I can receive emails @alexchiri.ro on [GMail](http://gmail.com).

The next logical step was to open another ticket, this time for not being able to add MX records. Now it gets funnier: they did 'something' again but after that it was not working anymore and I wasn't able to see it in [CPanel](http://cpanel.net/) (sounds familiar?). What pissed me of was that they were not telling me anything, just to wait for it to be fixed. I waited for a few days, in the meantime I was asking for updates everyday, to which they stopped answering after the first 2 days.

_'That's it'_, I said. _'I might be small and insignificant to you, but I have my pride!'_, so I went to [EuroVPS](http://eurovps.com). Created a new shared account, moved the domain and took the opportunity to update [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) to 3.5, change the theme and revise the plug-ins I used.

As you might have guessed, this wasn't the end of it, because 2 weeks ago the new hosting was hacked, my freshly moved blog was completely erased and I didn't get even a mail from [EuroVPS](http://eurovps.com) to let me know about the fact.

That's when I decided to move to a static blog, where my posts are written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) and hosted in [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com) and [Scriptogr.am](http://scriptogr.am) generates static htmls from it. I also attached `alexchiri.com` to my account to make my blog a bit more international!

I know the change doesn't make a lot of sense, but it feels good to try something new and I was really sick of reinstalling [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) and restoring the backed up database and so on. On top of that, this is completely FREE!

**There's this 'minor' problem about the old posts, from the `alexchiri.ro` era (I like it how it sounds! :D), I'll have to move them somehow, but that's a problem for the future!**
