Inspired by [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov)'s tweet and with a desire to get better at [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/), this weekend I became a little bit more active on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1904089/alexandru-chiri%C8%9Bescu).

I answered several ReactJS questions as best as I could and I gotta tell you, it's crazy addictive. You are also learning a lot, especially if you actually try to come up with fully working solutions for people's problems. After playing a little bit with [jsbin.com](https://jsbin.com) and [codepen.io](http://codepen.io/), I opted for using codepen, as it works well and it's cheaper than jsbin.

Here are some of the pens I created:



 	  * someone asked how to prevent deep linking when going directly to the link: http://codepen.io/alexchiri/pen/GZoRze
 	  * an example on how to pass properties to the children component using context: http://codepen.io/alexchiri/pen/WwQVRG
 	  * some fun with controlled inputs http://codepen.io/alexchiri/pen/BKjJYj
 	  * someone wanted to have access to the redux store from a `onEnter` hook handler: http://codepen.io/alexchiri/pen/yOevGZ
 	  * how to access location in route components: http://codepen.io/alexchiri/pen/zqrEBb

These are simply exercises, nothing very complicated, just to illustrate a concept or another with a working example.

**Best takeway** until now: if you want your answer to be selected, make sure you write a clear, succint, to-the-point answer, that the asker can use right away.
