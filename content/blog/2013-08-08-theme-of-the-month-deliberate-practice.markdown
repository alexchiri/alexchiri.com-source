I have been recently reading about performance and what makes you better. The term of 'deliberate practice' popped up more than once.

I'm halfway through the book [_Talent Is Overrated: What Really Separates World-Class Performers from Everybody Else_](http://www.amazon.com/Talent-Overrated-World-Class-Performers-EverybodyElse/dp/1591842948) by Geoff Colvin and I found quite some interesting things while reading it.

We all know that in order to get better at something we have to practice. Well, it seems that it is not enough and in order to get best results we should engage in something called 'deliberate practice' in [a study from the '90s](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/freakonomics/pdf/DeliberatePractice(PsychologicalReview).pdf).

Still not completely clear what it is (still reading the book) or how I could apply it in my field, but I'll put some thought on it and get back with some ideas.

In the meantime, [a google search](http://www.google.com/search?q=deliberate+practice) retrieves quite some results about this.
