Being surprised by the incredible weather this weekend, we decided to walk around Amsterdam a bit, like any tourist would do.

Here's our journey from this Saturday, accompanied by photos and some explanations([TREASURE MAP](https://mapsengine.google.com/map/edit?mid=zmpArB5FipwA.kRD27Wlg71n4)), follow the pointers on the map to get an idea where the photos were taken:

Our starting point, close to Centraal Station, near the luxurious Amrath Hotel and its 7 Seas restaurant. Amazing pillow of clouds in the background, incredible weather for this end of September.

In the center of the 2 images it's the [Montelbaanstoren](http://translate.google.nl/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&js=n&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fnl.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMontelbaanstoren), one of the defense towers of the old Amsterdam, now is the HQ of an organization, Secret Garden Foundation, that promotes gay, bisexual and trans-gender Muslims.

This lonely fellow can be found at the entrance of the City Hall, at Waterlooplein. Do pay him a visit, an artist is always happy to have an audience!

This is how sunny Amsterdam usually looks like, canals filled with boats and people celebrating the miracle of a clear sky.

If you continue through the gate in the image, you will get closer to the Zuider Kerk (Southern Church) whose tower is already visible. On the right side of the gate, inside the square there's a building with a very beautiful facade, which unfortunately is now being restored.

While there's no interesting landscape captured in this photo, I liked they way the colors combined. My excuses to the 2 swans which were doing their afternoon siesta.

If you thought there can't be any more doorways pictured in this article, here's another one. Through this entrance used to pass female beggars and prostitutes who were condemned to spin wool and do needlework, sort of a rudimentary correction facility. Today it hosts the Social Sciences and Behavior Faculty of Amsterdam University.

In Amsterdam used to live 2 brothers, Louis and Hendrik Trip. And these brothers wanted to live together, so they decided to build a symmetrical house for them.

The tower from the middle of this hotel (Doelen Hotel) is where [Rembrandt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rembrandt_Harmenszoon_van_Rijn)'s painting, [The Night Watch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_Watch), was initially housed. It was ordered by the captain of this defense tower. Check out the musketeers at the top, the legend says that one of them resembles Rembrandt.
