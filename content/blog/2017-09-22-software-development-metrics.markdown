## Some thoughts

Very good overview of metrics to be used in software development. I liked the structure of the book and how the metrics were split between metrics used for steering, improvement or both and what is particular when used for one or another.

I printed these metrics on paper cards, on one side the name and what they apply to (approach, process-model and delivery mode) and on the other side the notes specific to each purpose (steering or improvement). Left plenty of space on the front to write notes and whatever comes up while tracking the metrics. I'll keep those cards close by, for easy reference. If you'd like, you can download them and print them yourself from [here](https://02f3b4b6141f4e501887-67ab80ec00c7299bd1255995bf933a71.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/metrics_cards.pdf)!
