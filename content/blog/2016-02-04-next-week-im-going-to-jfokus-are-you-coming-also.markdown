I'm considering going to the [Hackergarten](http://hackergarten.net/) as well instead of some of the talks, but as there's no information about when it will be and what would we be hacking, I'll leave it to a tentative.

**Update:** The Hackergarten will happen on Tuesday, possibly extending to Wednesday, drop-in any time, stay as long as you want:
