Recently, I added a few new sources of agile info (and not only) into my RSS reader and I would like to share them with you:



 	  * [https://www.reddit.com/r/agile/](https://www.reddit.com/r/agile/)
 	  * [https://www.reddit.com/r/softwaredevelopment/](https://www.reddit.com/r/softwaredevelopment/)
 	  * [http://www.erikweberconsulting.com/blog/](http://www.erikweberconsulting.com/blog/)
 	  * [http://blog.crisp.se/](http://blog.crisp.se/)
 	  * [http://www.svpg.com/articles/](http://www.svpg.com/articles/)
 	  * [http://www.jrothman.com/blogs/](http://www.jrothman.com/blogs/)
 	  * [http://ryanripley.com/agile-for-humans/](http://ryanripley.com/agile-for-humans/)

If you didnâ€™t know, you can transform any reddit url in an RSS feed url by adding `.rss` at the end. Enjoy!
