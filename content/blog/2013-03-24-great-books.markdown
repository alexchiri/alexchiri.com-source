I've read some really great books in the last couple of years. Here's a list of those books.

The value of these books is relative to whatever the reader takes out from them. Just putting them in the 'read' list of [Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com/) won't make the reader rich, successful or in any way different.


# Already read





 	  * **Difficult Conversations: How to Discuss What Matters Most** by Douglas Stone, Bruce Patton, Sheila Heen

 	    * One of the best books I have read in the last period of time. It is useful to anyone interacting with another human being daily, it's really an eyeopener and it can help you find out more about yourself and understand better the people around you

 	    * Google's "Jolly good fellow" take on accessible meditation. In order to understand everybody else, we first have to get to know ourselves better. Good read, even though you might not fully apply this manual on meditation, there's plenty of things to take and apply daily without much effort.
