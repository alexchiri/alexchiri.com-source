After meeting Woody in a number of workshops and presentations about MOB programming, it was an unique and interesting opportunity to watch him talk about a different topic. He gave an inspiring talk about randomness, confirmation bias, serendipity, learning, experimenting, or as he called it _“stumbling purposely and purposeful stumbling”_. All of these coming from his own life experience, with a melange of personal stories, wise words and simply beautiful drawings.

What follows next are some of my random notes taken during the presentation and book references he mentioned.

[apophenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia) = tendency to seek patterns in random information.

<blockquote>confirmation bias - we value information that agrees with what we already believe over opinions and data that disagrees with our beliefs</blockquote>

<blockquote>So convenient a thing to be a reasonable creature, since it enables one to find or make a reason for every thing one has a mind to do. - Benjamin Franklin

It ain't so much the things we don't know that get us in trouble. It's the things we know that ain't so. - Artemus Ward</blockquote>

[serendipity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serendipity):

 * what if we could increase the chances of it
 * what if we would be willing to embrace it when we see it?

<blockquote>The value of another's experience is to give us hope, not to tell us how or whether to proceed. - Peter Block</blockquote>

<blockquote>I’m not a thought leader, I am just stumbling in the right direction

“Stumbling purposely and purposeful stumbling”

Perturbing the system</blockquote>

The buffet:

 * take a bit of a number of things, try each one
 * go back for more of the things you like
 * and take a bit of something new to try “each trip”
