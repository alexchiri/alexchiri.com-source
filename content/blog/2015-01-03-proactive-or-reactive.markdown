Just a few things I read this a couple of days ago about reactive/proactive:

"Our behaviour is a function of our decisions, not our conditions". If we choose to blame others for our conditions, we become reactive.
"Proactive people are driven by values - carefully thought about, selected and internationalised values" while "Reactive people are driven by feelings, by circumstances, by conditions, by their environment".

Reactive language:



 	  * There's nothing I can do.
 	  * That's just the way I am.
 	  * He makes me so mad.
 	  * They won't allow that.
 	  * I have to do that.
 	  * I can't.
 	  * I must.
 	  * If only.

Proactive language:

 	  * Let's look at our alternatives.
 	  * I can choose a different approach.
 	  * I control my own feelings.
 	  * I can create an effective presentation.
 	  * I will choose an appropriate response.
 	  * I choose.
 	  * I prefer.
 	  * I will.
