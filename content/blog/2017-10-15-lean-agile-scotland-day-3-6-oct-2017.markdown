The third day of LAScot was a little bit shorter for me, because I chose to come back to Stockholm on the same day. That gave me just enough time to see the keynote and [@JoakimSunden](https://twitter.com/joakimsunden)’s talk about the “Spotify Model”.


## Keynote: _Awesome Superproblems_ by Luke Hohmann ([@ LukeHohmann](https://twitter.com/lukehohmann))


Luke’s keynote was very inspiring. He demonstrated how our experience in building products and services can be used in other domains and parts of life. Using games to help community members to decide the budget of a whole city for the next year is an amazing feat. I wish more governments will follow suit and implement similar ways of allowing the people who they represent to contribute on running their country, region or city.

## Case Study: _You can do better than the Spotify Model_ by Joakim Sundén ([@JoakimSunden](https://twitter.com/joakimsunden))


I am convinced Joakim’s talk shattered a lot of people’s dreams, dreams of an ideal Spotify model of success, that can be easily copied and implemented in tech companies to make them successful. Truth is that even Spotify didn’t fully implement it and that the way Spotify organises itself is a living thing, that evolves and changes as the company changes. It is driven by company needs and unique context. Some things can be transplanted, but you should always take in the consideration your company’s needs and challenges and apply what it works for you.

<blockquote>There is a manager for ~ every 5 individual contributor and a lead for ~ every 2 individual contributor</blockquote>

This post is the last of a series of 3 posts, corresponding to the 3 days I attended at the conference: [notes from the first day](https://alexchiri.com/2017/10/09/lean-agile-scotland-day-1-4-oct-2017/) and [notes from the second day](https://alexchiri.com/2017/10/12/lean-agile-scotland-day-2-5-oct-2017/).
