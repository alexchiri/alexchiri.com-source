## My notes:


Treat a project with empathy.

As a PM talk about good things with 'we' and about negative with 'I'.

As a PM you have to be positive about the project and believe that will succeed.

Do not talk bad about the project until the end. Allow yourself in the post-mortem to hate the project a little bit.

You should be positive and shove the negative at the end without looking like you fake it or you are not genuine.

Not everyone needs the positivity during the projects maybe because they have more experience than others.

Try to be a project leader and not just a project manager.

## On a similar note


I listened to Ryan Ripley’s [Agile for Humans 048: How Project Managers Can Fit on Agile Teams podcast](http://ryanripley.com/afh-048-how-project-managers-can-fit-on-agile-teams-podcast/) which seems to attack the same topic from a different perspective and with different guests. Give that one a listen as well!
