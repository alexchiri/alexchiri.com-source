I have the impression that the general feeling towards the notion of newsletters is somewhere close to idea of spam. Lots of ads, poor content and usually showing up in your inbox without requesting it or without realising you have subscribed to it (check the tiny little checkboxes at the bottom of the forms!)

But there are exceptions, here are the newsletters that I am always happy to receive and actually look forward to. They deliver quality content, with reduced frequency (monthly or weekly), very little to no ads, on some of the topics am interested in: leadership, culture, products and books. And they are free (mostly).

The list of newsletter is not ordered in any way, they‚Äôre all great, subscribe to all or just to what tickles your interests.


## _Software Lead Weekly_ by Oren Ellenbogen ([@orenellenbogen](https://www.twitter.com/orenellenbogen)) - weekly, free




<blockquote>SWLW is a weekly newsletter with what I've seen in tech¬†about people,¬†culture¬†and leadership.¬†Curated with great care by @orenellenbogen</blockquote>


It‚Äôs a very good list of articles and there was no issue so far in which I didn‚Äôt find several interesting articles, worthy of sharing further on my social accounts. I also like that every link in the newsletter has an indication of how long would it take to read it and also link to add it to Pocket or Instapaper or to share it via Twitter or email.

## _Newsletter _by Mark Manson ([@IAmMarkManson](https://twitter.com/IAmMarkManson)) - weekly?, free & paid-only


Found out about Mark and his newsletter not after reading his book with a very catchy title, but after a Facebook friend shared an article from his blog. His newsletter is very low-key and it usually contains 2 articles, both written by him: one that is free and another one written specially for the users who pay the monthly fee to get extra content (besides the paid-only articles, several ebooks, videos and tutorials). All content is created by Mark.

## _Reading List_ by Ryan Holiday ([@RyanHoliday](https://twitter.com/RyanHoliday)) - monthly, free


Found out about Ryan‚Äôs newsletter after listening to the audiobook version of one of his books, Ego is the enemy. In the end, he talks about his reading passion, how this fuels his writing and how he gathers all the interesting the content he finds while reading.

His newsletter is a list of books that Ryan he read and recommends. Check out Ryan‚Äôs [approach on collecting, storing and categorising information](https://ryanholiday.net/how-and-why-to-keep-a-commonplace-book/) he finds useful while he reads.
