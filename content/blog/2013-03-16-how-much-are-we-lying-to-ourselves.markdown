Random thoughts about self-inflicted lies.

I think that each and every one of us lies to himself at least a few times a day. From the "I'll go pick up dry cleaning tomorrow, it's too cold today" to "He doesn't have a clue what he says, you're cool, he's just jealous".

...

People who don't accept critics are probably keeping themselves in some sort of pedestal, where nobody can touch them. Until some day when the ground is swept from under them and they wake up, wondering what did they do to deserve such things.

...

These days, we NEED to be successful more than ever before, we create for ourselves this reality of who we have to be, who we have to become. Maybe because of our parents, who want to see us a doctor or a lawyer and they steer us as well as they can. But we start to believe that made-up reality, because everybody has to be something and if not "this", then what?

...

Procrastination is a way of lying to ourselves, mostly harmless to others. We deceive ourselves because we don't want to let down our ego. Unless we do something, there's no way to fail at that thing. And failure is bad, so let's not try, let's leave failures for tomorrow, or the days after.
