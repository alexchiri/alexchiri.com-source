Maybe you heard, maybe you didn't, but there's a new challenge in town!

It's called **[Your Turn Challenge](http://yourturnchallenge.strikingly.com/)** and it's initiated by Winnie, the Special Projects Lead for [Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com). Now, it doesn't really matter who drives it, I've been wanting for some time to increase the number of my blog posts and get them coming in a more regular fashion.

The challenge consists in blogging every day of next week. All the posts will be gathered on a special [blog](http://yourturnchallenge.tumblr.com/) on [tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/) and you can also post the articles on your own blog at the same time.

So, let's see, will I be able to post every day, for 7 days? You can join me and challenge yourself, it's also your turn! __

P.S. If you were wondering, at the bottom of this, there's [Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com)'s latest book, which I didn't get to read, yet: [Your Turn](http://www.yourturn.link/products/your-turn). Buy 1, get 2, so you can share one with your friends.
