Or… should it be the other way around?

I’m always amazed about the amount of effort some people put in things that don’t need to be complicated. There is a general misconception that thorough and good work is recognised by the size of the deliverable. Therefore, insecure people will have the tendency to produce more and more complicated results, in an effort to compensate, to seem what they’re not.

Of course, we are often raised and educated that more is better, especially in communist educational systems. I met people while interviewing for jobs, who tried to overwhelm you with terms and fancy words, talking a lot, not letting much space for questions, because then they would have to prove knowledge of a deeper level. At first you are taken away of the vast knowledge the candidate has, but when he/she fails to break the surface, there’s a sign that something might not be what it seems.

And this can be applied to a lot of things: mission statements[1], bachelor thesis, PR communication, love letters, dog tags or burial stones.

More is not necessarily better and [less](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/less_is_more) is most of the time more!

1. For some examples of short/long or good/bad mission statements, check out [Guy Kawasaki](http://blog.guykawasaki.com/)’s [speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSlwuafyUUo) from TiEcon 2006 about his book, [The Art of the Start](http://www.guykawasaki.com/the-art-of-the-start/). ↩
