## Intro


I have to say, I usually don't read a lot of fiction or fantasy books, as in, I rarely go and search for a specific fiction book in a store. It's not that I don't like the genre, but I seem to feel guilty because I don't read something "serious" instead. There's also the search of something to read, going through top 10 lists, New York Times best sellers list and so on. Ohh, I'm not a big fan of doing that. But then I discovered the [Story Bundle](https://storybundle.com), a curated collection of books, which is released from time to time.


# THE bundle


There are several cool things about the bundle. First of all, it's a curated collection of books of a certain genre. So someone actually spent time putting this bundle together and selected the titles for you, so you don't have to do it.

Second, all the books are available in several ebook formats, WITHOUT DRM, which means you can read them on whatever device you wish. One of the reasons I chose to buy a Kobo Aura, was to be able to easily read on it any kind of ebook format, with or without DRM, but also to have access to a huge ebook store that integrates very well with the reader.

And third, you can pay as much as you want on the bundle. There's a minimum amount (which is amazingly low considering what you get) and if you pay more than the average value, you get the bonus books. You can also choose to donate a part of the money to charity.

I'll be honest, I've never heard of most of the authors from the bundles I bought until now (about 5 or 6) and I was a little bit reluctant about the quality of the writings. But after reading some of them without being able to put the reader down, I can tell you that most of the books I read are really well written.

These being said, I'll let you go check it out and I'll go take care of my own business, I'm a little bit behind with my reading! ;-)
