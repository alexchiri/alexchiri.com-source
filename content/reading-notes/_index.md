I like to read books and listen to audiobooks and podcasts. I like to share information with others. It is said that the best way to learn something is to try to communicate it or explain it to someone else. Which is why I created this section of this website. 

Each month, I will take the best ideas I stumbled upon during the month and put them in a post, like the ones here below. My hope is that you will find them useful and interesting and they might inspire you and help you choose the next book to read or podcast to listen. 

You can subscribe to the Reading Notes mailing list to receive all these posts through email, the moment I publish them here, maximum one email per month. [Follow this link to sign up!](https://sendfox.com/lp/1vl9ym)
