## PICK-MY-BRAIN-FOR-1-HOUR

Now that many of us work from 🏡, it would seem that this makes interactions harder. I guess it takes some getting used to. 💪 But it frees up time ⏰as well. So I thought why not use some of this time for talking with people online.  

For the following few weeks, I reserved 1 hour every day in my calendar to have a chat online with whomever is interested on whatever topic, but ideally related to #DevOps, #ContinuousDelivery, #agile, #coaching, #coding, #writing, #productivity, #leadership, #Kubernetes, #InfrastructureAsCode, #YouNameIt! 1 hour every workday. For free. No strings attached. 🚀

Book a time using the form below: <br/>
