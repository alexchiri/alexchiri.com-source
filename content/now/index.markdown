What am I thinking or doing now:

* DevOps and Continuous Delivery consultant at [Eficode Praqma](https://www.praqma.com).
* Chopping wood and carrying water every day and thinking about personal growth and what is the meaning of it all? 
* Enthusiastic member of the [Farnam Street Learning Community](https://fs.blog/membership).
* Practicing lots of [Rocket Yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Schultz), because it helps quiet the mind. üôè
* Constantly thinking about how to improve working environments and help people be happier at work.
* Trying, failing, learning, improving and repeat.
