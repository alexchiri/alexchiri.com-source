What am I thinking or doing now:

* Engineering Manager at [Klarna A.B.](https://www.klarna.com)
* Enthusiastic member of the [Farnam Street Learning Community](https://fs.blog/membership)
* Learning about systems thinking and how to apply them every day.
* Learning about [Probabilities and Statistics](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UCSanDiegoX+DSE210x+1T2019a/course/) on [edx](https://edx.org). I've been reading many studies lately and I want to be able to get a better understanding of the statistical results.
* Reading, formulating ideas and writing about my topics of interest.
* Running, because if feels good and weather is nice outside.
* Constantly thinking about how to improve working environments and help people be happier at work or at home.
* Trying, failing, learning, improving and repeat.
