What am I thinking or doing now:

* Experimenting with making videos about random stuff on [https://learn.alexchiri.com](https://learn.alexchiri.com) and on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSN2REk1FAr88cw0pO291hw).
* DevOps and Continuous Delivery consultant at [Eficode Praqma](https://www.praqma.com).
* Learning more and more about organizing thoughts using [RoamResearch](https://roamresearch.com/) in the [#roamcult](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23roamcult)
* Chopping wood and carrying water every day and thinking about personal growth and what is the meaning of it all? 
* Constantly thinking about how to improve working environments and help people be happier at work.
* Trying, failing, learning, improving and repeat.
