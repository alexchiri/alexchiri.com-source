What am I thinking or doing now:

* Learning how to be a full-time dad for my daughter or also known as junior [DadOps](https://dadops.xyz)
* Chopping wood and carrying water every day and thinking about personal growth and what is the meaning of it all? 
* Constantly thinking about how to improve working environments and help people be happier at work.
* Trying, failing, learning, improving and repeat.

On pause until the end of 2021:
* DevOps and Continuous Delivery consultant at [Eficode Praqma](https://www.praqma.com).
